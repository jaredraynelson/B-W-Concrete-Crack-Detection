# B & W Concrete Crack Detection

Detection of concrete cracks using CNN (Tensorflow Keras API)

Dataset: Concrete Crack Images for Classification The dataset with all the images used in this 
project was downloaded from Mendeley Data: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/5y9wdsg2zt.1#file-c0d86f9f-852e-4d00-bf45-9a0e24e3b932

How to use the files

The script will produce a training_dataset.npy file that will be used for further iterations to decrease the processing time.

Make sure these are installed before running the script:
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install tqdm
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install tensorflow

Simply Run the main.ipynb file, on the dataset, and you should be good to go. (:
